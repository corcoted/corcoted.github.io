  Preview of the 2018 DAMOP conference.
---
I just arrived in [Fort Lauderdale, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida) for the 2018 edition of the [American Physical Society](http://www.aps.org) [Divison of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics](https://www.aps.org/units/damop/index.cfm) (DAMOP) conference.
Over the next few days I'll try to write brief recaps of interesting things I see and relay some interesting conversations.  My first job is to skim through the [scientific program](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP18/Content/3507) and choose my adventure for the week.
Definite must-see events are the [prize session](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP18/Session/B01) (always the first thing: 8am on Tuesday), and the [Ph.D. thesis prize competition](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP18/Session/D03) on Tuesday afternoon.
Quickly glancing at the thesis prize abstracts it looks like no theory talks were nominated this year, which hasn't happened before in my recollection.

In addition to keeping up with the latest developments, I also try to catch old friends and colleagues.  The poster sessions are always great for that.  I'll be presenting a [poster myself on Thursday afternoon](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP18/Session/T01.134) on our quasicrystal project.  I hope to get useful feedback on what we're doing.

I'll sign off for now, but stay tuned throughout the week.
