Yesterday, I gave a fun talk to Eric Vogelstein's *Philosophy of Star Trek* class about time travel.
My goal was to give a broad overview of 20th century physics and how time travel might be plausible if we bend the established rules a little.
We had a fun discussion, and it was nice to see non-science students excited about things like quantum entanglement and event horizons.

[I'm posting my slides here if anyone is interested.](/assets/docs/TimeTravel-Corcovilos.pdf)

I consider myself little more than an informed novice on these topics, so corrections and feedback are welcome!
