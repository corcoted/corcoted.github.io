## Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) Physics

- Study of light and the interactions of light with matter


## Geometric descriptions of geometric optics

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Bring back 19th century geometry ideas and apply to modern optics
- Simplifies calculations for things like misaligned lenses
  - Poster outside my office
- Laser beams and "classical" light rays now obey the same rules

## Ultracold atoms in quasicrystal potentials

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Cool atoms down to nanokelvin temperature using lasers
- Load them into structures built from interfering laser beams
- Study materials that are hard to make using chemistry like quasicrystals

## Mathematical analysis of vibrato in music performance

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Sound and light are both waves, so we can describe them with the same math.
- The way wind musicians produce *vibrato* is not fully understood.
- Collaboration with Prof. [Paul Doerksen](https://www.duq.edu/faculty-and-staff/paul-doerksen.php) in School of Music

## Infrared Multi-Photon Dissociation of gas-phase ions

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Use infrared lasers to heat molecules until they break
- Look at the broken bits to learn about chemical bonding in
 u ranium and other actinide metals
- Collaborators:
  - Prof. [Michael Van Stipdonk](https://www.duq.edu/faculty-and-staff/michael-van-stipdonk.php) in Chemistry
  - Free Electron Laser for Infrared eXperiments ([FELIX](http://www.ru.nl/felix/)) at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands
  - Dr. Christopher Zarzana and Dr. Brittany Hodges at [Idaho National Laboratory](http://inl.gov)

## Optical detection of contaminants in water

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Measure color changes to quantify contaminants in drinking water like lead, fluoride, and iron
- Homemade device built by students for about $80 each replaces a $3000 device
  - Arduino "brain"
  - 3D printed body
- Collaboration with Prof. [David Kahler](https://davidmkahler.blogspot.com/) in Environmental Science

## Laser-Induced Fluorescence for Quantitation of Cross-Linking in Bio-polymers

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Put fluorescent "staples" on proteins then break them apart.
- Use a home-built microscope with microfluidic sample to count the "staples" to count the protein subunits
- Collaboration with Prof. [Michael Cascio](https://www.duq.edu/faculty-and-staff/michael-cascio.php) in Biochemistry
