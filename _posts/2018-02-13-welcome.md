Welcome to my new website and blog.
My primary goal for this site is to share my work and some of the ideas I have that are inspired by teaching, research, and life.
I'll post my latest work on the static pages of the site as a sort of online CV,
but the blog could be whatever strikes my fancy that I've been working on in the lab, the classroom, or tangents inspired by those things.
If I'm feeling up to it, I might veer off into what I'm doing outside of work and maybe an occassional rant.

I'm new to this, so I ask your patience as I get my sea legs, both in terms of writing and on the technical side of running the website.

Thanks for visiting!
