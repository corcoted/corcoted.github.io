In the [last](/posts/2022-05-20-HomogeneousOptics-1.qmd) [three](/posts/2022-05-20-HomogeneousOptics-1.qmd) [posts](/posts/2022-05-20-HomogeneousOptics-3.qmd) I laid out the main ideas from my recent paper[@corcovilos2023].
Here I want to demonstrate using these on a simple example optical system.
As a reminder, this is all in the realm of paraxial geometric optics, so I can't address aberations or diffraction, but I can calculate other useful properties.

The example is a basic compound microscope.  Here are the key elements:

- The objective is a converging lens of focal length *f~O~*&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.600&nbsp;mm with a clear aperture diameter of *d~O~*&nbsp;=4.000&nbsp;mm.  The aperture stop of the system is the objective lens.
- The eyepiece is a converging lens of focal length *f~E~*&nbsp;=25.00&nbsp;mm and a clear aperture of *d~E~*&nbsp;=&nbsp;18.00&nbsp;mm.
- The distance between the objective and the eyepiece is 189.2&nbsp;mm.
- There is an internal aperature located 162.0&nbsp;mm behind the objective lens.  Its diameter is *d~S~*&nbsp;=10.00&nbsp;mm.  This functions as the field stop.

```{python}
from sympy import *
init_printing()
```

```{python}
f_O, f_E = symbols('f_O f_E', real=True)
d_O, d_E, d_S = symbols('d_O d_E d_S', positive=True)
t_OE, t_OS, t_SE = symbols('t_OE t_OS t_SE', positive=True)
NP, COC = symbols('NP COC', positive=True)

# distances in mm
values = {f_O: 1.600, # objective focal length
          f_E: 25.00, # eyepiece focal length
          d_O: 4.000, # objective diameter
          d_E: 18.00, # eyepiece diameter
          d_S: 10.00, # field stop diameter
          t_OE: 189.2, # distance from objective to eyepiece
          t_OS: 162.0, # distance from objective to field stop
          t_SE: 27.2, # distance from field stop to eyepiece
          NP: 250.0, # near point distance (eye to image)
          COC: 0.1 # circle of confusion in eye
          }
```

We'll assume that the user of the microscope has normal vision and that the final image will be located at the eye's near point distance of 250.0&nbsp;mm.
We'll also assume that the eye is located at the exit pupil of the instrument (the usual design for microscopes and telescopes).

The things we want to calculate are

a. The location of the exit pupil (and hence the eye).
b. The image and object locations.
c. The magnification.
d. The numerical aperture and diffraction limit of the microscope.
e. The locations of the entrance and exit windows.
f. The field of view.
g. The depth of field.

## Traditional solution
Here is how the problem is typically done using the Gaussian imaging equation and some geometry, like you might find in Hecht[@hecht] or Pedrotti[@pedrotti].

### Exit pupil
The exit pupil is the image of the aperture on the image side of the system.
In other words, this is the image of the objective's aperture formed by the eyepiece.
Using the Gaussian lens equation we can solve for the distance from the eyepiece to the exit pupil (*t~EXP~*):

```{python}

t_EXP = symbols('t_EXP', real=True) # distance from eyepiece to exit pupil
eq1 = Eq(1/t_OE + 1/t_EXP, 1/f_E)
display(eq1)

display(Eq(t_EXP,solve(eq1,t_EXP)[0]))

values[t_EXP] = solve(eq1,t_EXP)[0].subs(values)
display(Eq(t_EXP,t_EXP.subs(values),evaluate=False))
```

The diameter of the exit pupil (*d~XP~*) is found by calculating the magnification of the image of the objective aperture.

```{python}
d_XP = symbols('d_XP', positive=True)
display(Eq(d_XP,-t_EXP/t_OE*d_O,evaluate=False))
values[d_XP]= abs(-t_EXP/t_OE*d_O).subs(values)
Eq(d_XP,d_XP.subs(values),evaluate=False)
```

```{python}
#| output: asis
print(rf'$$ d_{{XP}} = {d_XP.subs(values):.3f} $$')
```
where in the last line I discarded the minus sign because we're just interested in the size.

::: {.callout-warning}
The value of *d~XP~* looks small to me.  Should check against real microscopes.  I'm already using an NA of about 0.8, so I don't think increasing *d~O~* makes sense.
:::

### Image and object locations
Now that we know the location of the eye, we go backwards to locate the image.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# location of final image relative to eyepiece location
Eq(t_EXP-NP, (t_EXP-NP).subs(values),evaluate=False)

# location of intermediate image relative to eyepiece
#(1/(1/(t_EXP-NP)-1/f_E)).subs(values)

# location of intermediate image relative to objective
#(_+t_OE).subs(values)  #may fail _ is above result

# location of object relative to objective
#1/(1/_-1/f_O).subs(values)
```


Finish up by calculating magnification, NA, Rayleigh limit.

Then find the NW to get the field of view.

Finally, depth of field.  (eye has nominally 1 arc minute of angular resolution.)
