*This post is long overdue.  I beg forgiveness, dear reader, as real life took precidence for a couple of weeks.  Yes, it was vacation, but that's important, too.*

The DAMOP session on graduate admissions was enlightening and disheartening.  Best practices are not being followed by schools or by students.  I'll discuss a little of what I learned here.

The session it self was held on Wednesday, May 30, and was titled "Rethinking Graduate Admissions."
Here are the [abstracts](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP18/Session/K08).  The presentations were

* Casey Miller (Rochester Tech.) - "Typical physics PhD admissions parameters limit access to underrepresented groups and US citizens but fail to predict doctoral completion"
* Geoff Potvin (Florida International U.) - "Comparing student and faculty perceptions of graduate admissions"
* Geraldine Cochren (Rutgers) - "Identifying barriers to applying to graduate physics programs, an intersectional approach"
* Ted Hodapp (APS) - "APS Bridge Program: Changing the face of physics graduate education"

### Summary

I won't do a play-by-play of the session, but I do feel it is important to share what I perceived as the key points of the session.
I think that everyone in attendance recognizes that physics in the US is still a dominantly white-cis-hetero-male culture, and that diversifying the field will benefit us all.
The overarching problem is that we have few concrete ideas for accomplishing this.
First, although this wasn't the topic of the session, we must police ourselves and [remove those who harrass and discriminate](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/05/sexual-harassment-science-me-too-essay/) against women, racial minorities, and LGBTQ individuals so that physics builds a more welcoming environment.

Many of us bemoan the "leaky pipeline" that causes women and minorities to lose interest in physics as they go from children to teenagers to college students to graduate students to professionals,
but there are some places where we've drilled the holes into the pipeline ourselves.
The graduate admissions process is one.
(And it seems likely that these same faults apply to undergraduate recruiting as well.)



### Casey Miller
Women and several ethnic/race groups underrepresented (African-Americans severely).
Admissions process could be partly to blame.
Filters used as first step are biased, so potential applicants don't make it to next steps.

Completion rates for Ph.D. are also lower for affected groups.

GRE scores are +/-60 out of 800 (ETS scoring guide).
Also cutoffs are strongly discouraged.

Published cutoffs already exclude more that 75% of Native Am., Afr. Am. and Hispanics.
Pre-existing factors lower test scores.
Faculty are not trained to interpret test scores and have their own biases.

No validity study of GRE exists because there is no control group.

Study of outcomes for 4000 students done.
Grad GPA correlated most strongly (r=0.33) with undergraduate GPA.
GRE-Physics is only weakly correlated (r=0.24).
Biggest correlation is which grad school.  (Grade inflation?)
None of the correlations are strong.  (Most is 0.3 on GPA).

"Low GRE scores neq inability to earn physics PhD"
