### Casey Miller
Women and several ethnic/race groups underrepresented (African-Americans severely).
Admissions process could be partly to blame.
Filters used as first step are biased, so potential applicants don't make it to next steps.

Completion rates for Ph.D. are also lower for affected groups.

GRE scores are +/-60 out of 800 (ETS scoring guide).
Also cutoffs are strongly discouraged.

Published cutoffs already exclude more that 75% of Native Am., Afr. Am. and Hispanics.
Pre-existing factors lower test scores.
Faculty are not trained to interpret test scores and have their own biases.

No validity study of GRE exists because there is no control group.

Study of outcomes for 4000 students done.
Grad GPA correlated most strongly (r=0.33) with undergraduate GPA.
GRE-Physics is only weakly correlated (r=0.24).
Biggest correlation is which grad school.  (Grade inflation?)
None of the correlations are strong.  (Most is 0.3 on GPA).
