*This post is long overdue.  I beg forgiveness, dear reader, as real life took precidence for a couple of weeks.  Yes, it was vacation, but that's important, too.*

The DAMOP session on graduate admissions was enlightening and disheartening.  Best practices are not being followed by schools or by students.  I'll discuss a little of what I learned here.

The session it self was held on Wednesday, May 30, and was titled "Rethinking Graduate Admissions."
Here are the [abstracts](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP18/Session/K08).  The presentations were

* Casey Miller (Rochester Tech.) - "Typical physics PhD admissions parameters limit access to underrepresented groups and US citizens but fail to predict doctoral completion"
* Geoff Potvin (Florida International U.) - "Comparing student and faculty perceptions of graduate admissions"
* Geraldine Cochren (Rutgers) - "Identifying barriers to applying to graduate physics programs, an intersectional approach"
* Ted Hodapp (APS) - "APS Bridge Program: Changing the face of physics graduate education"

### Summary

I won't do a play-by-play of the session, but I do feel it is important to share what I perceived as the key points of the session.
I think that everyone in attendance recognizes that physics in the US is still a dominantly white-cis-hetero-male culture, and that diversifying the field will benefit us all.
The overarching problem is that we have few concrete ideas for accomplishing this.
First, although this wasn't the topic of the session, we must police ourselves and [remove those who harrass and discriminate](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/05/sexual-harassment-science-me-too-essay/) against women, racial minorities, and LGBTQ individuals so that physics builds a more welcoming environment.

Many of us bemoan the "leaky pipeline" that causes women and minorities to lose interest in physics as they go from children to teenagers to college students to graduate students to professionals,
but there are some places where we've drilled the holes into the pipeline ourselves.
The graduate admissions process is one.
(And it seems likely that these same faults apply to undergraduate recruiting as well.)

### The GRE is flawed, or at least it doesn't do what we think it does.

Miller discussed two major flaws with relying on the Physics GRE for admissions decissions.
First, despite the best efforts of the exam designers, the test scores are biased against underrepresented minorites.
This doesn't appear to be a problem with the questions on the exam, but rather the testing process itself.
The standardized testing environment causes added stress to minorities (e.g. [sterotype threat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat)), causing them to do more poorly than their ability would predict.
According to Miller, this causes significantly lower Physics GRE scores.
The most affected groups are African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans.
White women see a smaller, but still significant effect, and intersectionality (belonging to more than one minority group) compounds the decrease.

As a result of the testing bias, when graduate admissions committees use cutoffs (minimum percentile scores or minimum raw scores) to exclude applicants, *as many as 75% of underrepresented applicants are automatically excluded*.
At least a third of physics PhD programs use these cutoffs,[^1]
with many others using "soft" cutoffs (whatever that means) or otherwise making the GRE physics exam a major component in admissions decisions.

It's easy to demonize departments for doing this, but the task they have is daunting.
They have to whittle down perhaps hundreds of applications into a few dozen for closer consideration.
Using test scores is easy, and it is easy to mistakenly believe that the tests are objective.
However, it clearly doesn't work as intended.

Nor can [ETS](http://www.ets.org), the company that adminsters the test, be solely to blame.
In [their own score interpretation guide](https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_guide.pdf), they warn against using cutoffs for exactly the reasons above:[^2]

> The GRE Board believes that GRE scores should never be 
> the sole basis for an admissions decision and 
> that it is inadvisable to reject an applicant solely 
> on the basis of GRE scores. A cutoff score 
> below which every applicant is categorically 
> rejected without consideration of any other 
> information should not be used.

This brings me to Miller's second point: *the GRE Physics exam does not predict success in graduate school*.
He showed data showing nearly zero correlation between GRE Physics scores and grad school GPA.
There is an acknowledged survivor's bias in the data -- students who weren't admitted into grad school were obviously missing from the data -- but the trend is concerning and puts the use of test scores for admissions further into doubt.
Among the variables that Miller discussed, undergraduate GPA was the best predictor of success, but even that correlation was weak (r = 0.3 is what I put in my notes).

What Miller advocates for is a holistic admissions process, and given the data above, it seems clear to me that this is imperative.

### Faculty and students view admissions standards differently

The talks by Potvin and Cochran both addressed the topic of perceptions of graduate admissions.
Potvin presented some survey data and Cochran presented some interview results of students from underrepresented groups.
