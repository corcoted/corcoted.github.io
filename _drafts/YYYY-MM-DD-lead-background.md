One of my major [research projects](/research) is building an inexpensive handheld device for measuring the amount of lead in drinking water.  This is the first of several planned posts on the project.  Today, I'd like to introduce the problem we're trying to solve and talk particularly about lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water.  Part 2 will talk about some of the ethical and legal issues regarding the lead testing (at least as far as I understand them), and Part 3 will be about the device itself.  My intention is to keep this a "living" post, and update it as new information and results develop.

## Lead
Let's start at the very basic level.  [Lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead) is a metallic chemical element with an atomic number of 82 and its most common isotope has an atomic mass of 208.  From a physics perspective, lead is interesting because it is the heaviest stable element.  Lead-208 has a doubly [magic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(physics)); it and the other stable isotopes of lead form the termination of the nuclear [decay chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain) for almost all of the heavier elements.

From a technological point of view, lead was useful because it is soft and has a low melting point (327 &deg;C).  This made it easy to form, which may be why the ancient Romans used it for pipes ("Plumbing" and the chemical symbol Pb derive from the Latin word for lead), and the metal itself was cheap and common, being a waste product of silver refining.  In more recent times, it was used as solder to bond copper pipes and wires.
Lead is also extremely dense (11 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), which is why it was used for fishing sinkers, bullets, and ballast.
Copper and brass is often alloyed with lead to make it more machineable.

Chemically, lead is a member of the carbon group (Group 14) in the periodic table.  Its most common oxidation states are +2 and +4.  Lead(II) carbonate and lead(II,IV) oxide were commonly used as pigments (white and red, resp.) until they were banned in the 1970s.  Tetraethyllead was used as a gasoline additive until it was phased-out beginning in 1975 and ending in 1995 in the U.S.  Lead compounds (particularly lead(II) acetate) have a sweet taste, making them a common food adulterant going back as far as ancient Rome and continuing illicitly today.

## Lead is bad
The health effects of lead were suspected as early as the Roman days and began to be taken seriously as early as the late 1800's.
