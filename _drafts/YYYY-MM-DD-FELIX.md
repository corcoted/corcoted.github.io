This week I've been in the Netherlands at [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl/english) to use the [FELIX](http://www.ru.nl/felix/) free electron laser.
I'm here with [Mike Van Stipdonk](https://www.duq.edu/academics/faculty/michael-van-stipdonk) of the Duquesne Chemistry department and his students Luke Metzler and Connor Graca to do infrared spectrscopy on some gas-phase ion systems.
