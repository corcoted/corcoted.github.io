We just finished a recruiting blitz for our new [Professional Master's Degree in Applied Physics program](https://www.duq.edu/academics/schools/natural-and-environmental-sciences/academics/departments-and-programs/physics/professional-masters-degree-in-applied-physics).
I thought it would be useful to share some insights I've had about the program creation process and our design philosophy.

## Initial steps
The idea of having a professional master's program was first formally stated in 2014 during a periodic external departmental review as a way for the department to grow while complementing the strong research output of our faculty.
The "professional" part came out of
1. the need to differentiate our proposed program from the traditional (academic) master's programs already in place at the larger research universities in Pittsburgh,
2. a growing pressure for "workforce development" and putting students directly into jobs, and
3. because of the unfair perception of a physics master's degree being primarily for those students who drop out of Ph.D. programs.

(Also, we wanted to avoid the rather unfortunate phrase "terminal master's".)

The basic idea of "professional" programs is to add business skills to the curriculum.
At the time, we left things at that, as only a vague picture of where we were going, but it was enough to
start going through the administrative processes for starting a new program.

## Fact finding
Pretty quickly we realized that our new program couldn't just be some mix of graduate versions of undergrad classes (Graduate E&M, Graduate Quantum, etc.) plus a sprinkle of business.
But those were all classes we understood, because all of the faculty took classes like that in our Ph.D. work.
What to replace those with was not so obvious.
We did, however, have a clear goal for our students: _to get them jobs._

So, we went out and started talking to people who had jobs.

By that, I mean that we started talking to recent alumni who were working in industry, either immediately after graduating with a bachelor's degree or who had gone on to a graduate degree before entering the non-academic workforce.
Our department chair contacted a couple of former students that she had kept in touch with
