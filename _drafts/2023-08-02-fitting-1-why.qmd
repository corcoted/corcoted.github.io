  Why do we try to fit equations to data? (Part 1 of a series)
---

One of the main applications of statistics in the physical sciences is fitting to data to extract the values of some parameter we're trying to measure.
I think most of us have fit lines to data, for example, but we often treat this process as a black box (e.g. *Add trendline* in Excel) and don't stop to think if the result is useful, or even what it means.
For more sophisticated problems, we might perform a fit by minimizing some score function (distance squared or χ²), but where do those score functions come from, and how do we know the "best" one?
Often fitting requires us to provide an initial guess of the very things we're trying to measure.
Does that guess influence our answer?  What if we have trouble finding a guess that gives us any result?

Over the next few weeks, I'm going to walk through some examples of how we use fitting in physics, and hopefully give a better picture of how *uncertainty* enters into the analysis of data.
The goal is application.
To that end, I'll share some example Python code to do the calculations, but the ideas are useful regardless of the tool you use to do the actual calculations.

## Python setup

In each blog post I'll list the python libraries I'm using.
In practice, I use either Jupyter or Microsoft Visual Studio Code with the python and Jupyter notebook extensions.
I'll describe my workflow in a supplemental post to provide a stepping-off point.
