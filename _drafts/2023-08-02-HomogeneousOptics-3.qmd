  Our new 3&nbsp;3 ray matrices give us shortcuts to finding images.

This is the third post discussing my recent paper on a new way to look at geometric optics.
I deconstruct the familiar ABCD ray-transfer matrices and rebuild them based on geometric considerations.
The paper itself is published in *American Journal of Physics*[^1].
These blog posts will focus on the motivation and how to use the results.

## Picking up from last time...
![The equation of an oriented line. In this example, _a_ and _b_ > 0 and _c_<0.](/assets/figs/2022-optics/line.svg){ alt-text="Graph of a line"}

In the [first post](/posts/2022-05-20-HomogeneousOptics-1.qmd) I defined an oriented line by considering the equation of a line in 2D:
$ ax+by+c = 0 $.
This gave us 3&times;3 matrices for describing our optical system that contain the traditional *ABCD* matrices as a subset.

The [second post](/posts/2022-07-01-HomogeneousOptics-2.qmd) showed that the extra degrees of freedom also let us move and rotate our optical elements: we're no longer confined to being centered on and normal to a single optical axis.

In this post, I show a little slight of hand using projective geometry that lets us reframe our matrices as transformations of *points* rather than rays.  In other words, we can do imaging calculations directly from the matrices without going through the usual process of tracing rays.
