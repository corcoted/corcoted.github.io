  A brief meeting with a math colleague opened both of our eyes about helping our students.

Earlier this week I sat down with a colleague from the math department who had the thankless task of evaluating my teaching this semester.
First, a little background.
Most evaluations at our university are done by tenured faculty within the same department, but because our department is so small, my reviews usually come from folks from the other science departments.
This time around, the usual chemistry and biology people were too busy, so I ventured out to the math department to ask for a review.
It turned out that this was a great idea.

I think anyone in physics knows how much math we use.
In fact, we probably take it for granted.
Just as an example, at our university, the physics B.S. degree already contains enough classes for a math minor, and is only about three courses short of a full second degree in math.
And anyone who teaches physics or takes a physics class knows that we spend a lot of time teaching math:
vectors, calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, the list goes on....

So, with that as context, my math friend sat in on two of my quantum mechanics lectures, and saw first hand how we use math in physics, and how integral it is to what we do.
Reading between the lines of our later discussion, I think she had two reactions.
First, she was grateful that her students were actually using the things that she taught them.
And second, she saw that we emphasize slightly different things when we use math in physics than what she is used to.
This lead to a long talk between us about what math we need in physics and how we use it,
and hopefully a continuing dialog between our departments.

In the end, this simple interaction could make a difference to our students by improving the synergy of their coursework.
So, to my physics colleagues at other universities, go find a math professor and give them a hug, or at least take them out for a cup of coffee.
