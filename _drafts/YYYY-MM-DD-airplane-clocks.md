  Brief summary or excerpt of the post.

Last week I gave a homework problem on one of my favorite experiments testing relativity: flying atomic clocks around the world on commercial airplanes to measure time dilation.
The original experiment was published in *Science* 1972 by Hafele and Keating[^1].
The experiment tests two aspects of Einstein's relativity: moving clocks move slower (time dilation) and clocks in gravity move slower (gravitational redshift).
