Last week I gave a homework problem on one of my favorite experiments testing relativity: flying atomic clocks around the world on commercial airplanes to measure time dilation.
The original experiment was published in *Science* 1972 by Hafele and Keating[^1].
The experiment tests two aspects of Einstein's relativity: moving clocks move slower (time dilation) and clocks in gravity move slower (gravitational redshift).

## Background ##
### Time dilation ###
Time dilation can be stated simply as "moving clocks are slower than stationary clocks."  In Einstein's first paper on Special Relativity[^2], he gives a nice derivation of this using a thought experiment with a moving train.  If I call the time measured on the stationary clock as *t* and the moving clock as *t'*, the two values are related by

$$  t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}\,t' $$

where *v* is the speed of the moving clock, as measured by the stationary clock, and *c* is the speed of light.  The factor out in front of *t'* appears often enough that we'll give it a new name, *&gamma;*.  One important prediction of relativity is that no massive object can move faster than light, so *v* < *c*, making *&gamma;* > 1 and, therefore, *t* > *t'*.  So, the stationary clock records a longer time interval than the moving clock.  Or, as we said before "moving clocks are slower."
