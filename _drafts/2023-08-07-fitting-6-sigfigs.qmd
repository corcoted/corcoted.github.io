  One of the first things we teach about uncertainty is the concept of *significant figures* and rules for how many digits to keep when doing arithmetic.
  Similarly, in lab we teach rules for *propagation of errors* that serve a similar role.
  These are poor approximations that should only be used if you're stranded on a deserted island with no access to a computer.

## Notes
See the wikipedia page on [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), particularly [Common misconceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem#Common_misconceptions).  The latter has some bad things we tell students.
