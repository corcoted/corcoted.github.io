  In physical sciences we usually don't enter an experiment completely blind.  Usually we have some contraints on our fitting parameters (e.g., the mass of the Earth must be a positive number) or someone has done an experiment before us, and we're trying refine their results.  We can build these prior beliefs into our model, bringing us to Bayesian methods.
