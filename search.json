    "text": "This idea came from a homework problem I gave my Optics class: start with an eyeglass prescription and determine the near and far limits of clear vision. The following is the reverse of that problem.\nMost of us are familiar with the refraction exam done by optometrists to determine our eyeglass prescription. The test involves the patient trying to read a chart placed at reading distance (20 in ≈ 50 cm) or at a standard far distance (20 ft ≈ 6 m) while the optometrist tries placing different lenses in front of each eye to find the lenses that give the best image for the patient. The test is largely trial-and-error. A good practicioner can reach an optimal lens with only a few trials. Here’s a method to measure myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and presbyopia (age-related farsightedness) without the fancy equipment. The only tool we need is a tape measure and an object to look at, like a chart or point-source of light like an LED.\n(Unfortunately this test doesn’t work for astigmatism, the other common vision defect, without a special charge. Some suggestions for this below.)"

    "text": "Physics-y stuff\nThe theme I’ve been riding recently is things that aren’t taught to physicists but maybe should be. These are actual physics topics or physics-tangent topics that I know next to nothing about and didn’t really even hear about until recently. (I also have a list of non-physics things that I think physicists tend to lack, but that’s a rant for another day.) I am a rank novice in the topics below, so please forgive any errors. I’ll post more on these if I gain any shareable insights.\n\nGeometric Algebra for Physicists by Chris Doran and Anthony Lasenby (Cambridge, 2003)\n\n\nGeometric Algebra comes from W. K. Clifford’s work in the late 1890’s to build up higher dimensional objects from products of vectors without throwing away information. This book is an overview aimed at applications to physics, particularly electrodynamics and relativistic quantum mechanics.\nSo, here’s what bugs me about all of this. All of this stuff is old news to mathematicians. It just hasn’t trickled down from the ethereal heights of pure rational thought to us ground dwellers on the material plane. I bailed on the pure math classes as an undergrad, so I can only blame myself that I can’t parse the jargon and writing style of math literature, but I wish there were more accessible resources for learning higher math. This book is a small crack in the wall to help me think about these things.  ### Dynamics: Theory and Application of Kane’s Method by Carlos M. Roithmayr and Dewey H. Hodges \nI stumbled across “Kane’s Method” while reading through the docs for the python sympy package’s physics module. (Here is the implementation of Kane’s Method.) I’d never heard of this before, but I asked a former student who had just finished engineering school and he gave me a funny look like I had asked him if the sky was blue. Here’s a trick that the engineers know that passed by the physics community. (It’s not even in Wikipedia, if you can believe that!)\nKane’s Method is a way of solving classical mechanics problems for complex systems. It is used for similar problems to what we in physics use Lagrangian mechanics for, but instead of being based on energy it is based on forces. The improvement of Kane over standard Newtonian mechanics is that you can use generalized coordinates and constraints. It’s also useful for numerical work because the final equations are first order and robust to linearization over short time steps.\nAnyway, this sounded cool, so I picked up a textbook to try to learn it. I’m struggling with the notation at the moment (the book works in terms of components in specific frames rather than more abstract vectors), but the ideas themselves seem straightforward. I’ll report back soon!  ## Non-physics non-fiction\nI’m a big fan of history, so that’s the majority of my nonfiction reading.\n\n\nGrant by Ron Chernow\n\n\nA modern biography of Ulysses S. Grant going beyond the U.S. Civil War to his post-war military career and presidency. The Civil War is a favorite of mine, but I’ll admit my grasp of history ends at Lincoln’s assassination. Reading about the Reconstruction, in particularly the atrocities during the Andrew Johnson administration were eye-opening for me. As bad as our current politics are, at least people are not being murdered en masse because of their political party, for example in New Orleans in 1866, but also throughout the South. I knew about the original Ku Klux Klan, but didn’t realize that their hatred went beyond former slaves to anyone who opposed the restoration of slavery. This period is a stain upon the U.S. second only to slavery itself.\nGrowing up in Tennessee we were taught that the impeachment of Andrew Johnson was unjust, famously as recounted in John F. Kennedy’s Profiles in Courage regarding Kansas Sen. Edmund G. Ross who cast the deciding vote for acquittal. Upon reading Chernow’s recounting of the incident, it may have been unjust in that no actual crime was committed, but I can see why many were desperate to remove him from power beyond partisan animosity.\nI also knew nothing about Grant’s presidency except that it somehow landed him on the $50 bill. He was remarkably progressive and sought to revive Lincoln’s legacy not just in honor to the man himself but because he felt it was morally the right thing to do. Grant’s poor reputation afterwards comes from the various corruption scandals that rocked his administration (he was truly a political naïf, easily manipulated), but his constant fight against racism of all stripes (not just against African Americans but also Native Americans and Jews) belong to a later century. Ta-Nehisi Coates’ recent collection of essays We Were Eight Years in Power takes its title from a quote of Frederick Douglass about the Grant administration. Coates’ chose the title to emphasize how much was lost during Jim Crowe, ironically knowing that most people would assume it was about the Obama administration.  ## Fiction I’m a fan of science fiction and fantasy. (Yes, how stereotypical. I don’t care.) Two of the first books I read in this category were Lord of the Rings and Dune, back when I was in middle school, so it was a long time before I could stop comparing everything to those high bars. For a long time I avoided sci-fi and fantasy, preferring classics, but I credit my grad school mates with bringing me back to genre fiction.\nHere’s what’s on my screen now:\n\n\nToll the Hounds, Book 8 of The Malazan Book of the Fallen by Stephen Erickson\n\n\nThis is my third time reading through this series, despite the constant teasing by my wife that I’ve been reading the same book for more than 5 years. (I promise I read other things, too!) Erickson is a master of the long game, and by long, I mean foreshadowing that spans 10 books and tales that reach back longer than the history of humanity. World-building is as much a trope as anything in the fantasy literature, but few have mastered it like Erickson and his collaborator Ian Esselmont. The backstory here feels lived in, much as Tolkien’s did, but the gods and immortals here are active characters. I’m amazed at the intricacy of the tales in the series and the way that they interlock, but more than just being a word puzzle, these books are character driven, like Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time, but with a larger cast and longer span. The evil that Erickson paints is palpable and frightening in how it is built organically from the cultures and characters he creates. But more overwhelming is the soft counter melody of compassion that runs through and peaks out at unexpected moments.\nThe only way to fully appreciation MBotF is on a re-read; once you know where things are going, reading these characters brings new depth. It’s a tough read – readers are challenged to keep track of lots of characters and places and exposition is used sparingly or in unlikely hints – but well worth the effort.\nThis particular volume is the only one (I think) with a distinct narrator: the most glorious Kruppe, corpulent thief and weaver of tales, who begins the series as comic belief and ends as something much more."

    "text": "What is Lead?\nLet’s start at the very basic level. Lead is a metallic chemical element with an atomic number of 82 and its most common isotope has an atomic mass of 208. From a physics perspective, lead is interesting because it is the heaviest stable element. Lead-208 has a doubly magic nucleus; it and the other stable isotopes of lead form the termination of the nuclear decay chains for almost all of the heavier elements.\nFrom a technological point of view, lead was useful because it is soft and has a low melting point (327 °C). This made it easy to form, which may be why the ancient Romans used it for pipes (“Plumbing” and the chemical symbol Pb derive from the Latin word for lead), and the metal itself was cheap and common, being a waste product of silver refining. In more recent times, it was used as solder to bond copper pipes and wires. Lead is also extremely dense (11 g/cm3), which is why it was used for fishing sinkers, bullets, and ballast. Copper and brass is often alloyed with lead to make it more machineable.\nChemically, lead is a member of the carbon group (Group 14) in the periodic table. Its most common oxidation states are +2 and +4. Lead(II) carbonate and lead(II,IV) oxide were commonly used as pigments (white and red, resp.) until they were banned in the 1970s. Tetraethyllead was used as a gasoline additive until it was phased-out beginning in 1975 and ending in 1995 in the U.S. Lead compounds (particularly lead(II) acetate) have a sweet taste, making them a common food adulterant going back as far as ancient Rome and continuing illicitly today."

    "text": "Lead is bad\nThe health effects of lead were suspected as early as the Roman days and began to be taken seriously as early as the late 1800’s. Today the largest concern is the effect of lead exposure to children.\n\n\n\nPercentage of children under 6 years of age who had blood lead levels &gt; 10μg/dL in 2015.1\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rank lead as the most common environmental toxin and the second highest priority among toxic substances, behind arsenic2. Children exposed to lead exhibit long lasting physiological, mental, and behavioral problems such as lower IQ, ADHD3, and lower school performance4. One of the most frustrating aspects about the response to lead exposure in the U.S. is that mandatory remediation of lead in homes is only done after a child or pregnant woman tests positive for elevated blood lead levels (&gt;5μg/dL). In my opinion, this is clearly too late as damage has already been done. This was the case in Flint, MI. The first indication of a problem in the city’s water was when pediatricians noticed a sudden increase in positive blood tests for lead in toddlers.5 Only after this was the water suspected. Testing should be done to help prevent exposure, not diagnose it after it occurs.\nLead poisoning in children is caused almost exclusively by ingestion. Toddlers in particular, will stick anything into their mouths. The most common sources of lead exposure in children are * Lead paint in homes built before 1978 * Lead pipes in homes built before 1950 * Lead in soil, caused by burning of leaded gasoline before 1986 and industrial waste.\nWhile it is believed that lead paint is still the largest contributor to childhood lead poisoning6, several recent, high-profile cases, including the discovery of high lead levels in the domestic water supplies of Washington, DC in 2001 and Flint, MI in 2014, have motivated our effort to rapidly and reliably measure lead concentration in home drinking water. As shown in the 2015 blood test data7 (see figure inset above), Pennsylvania ranks worst among U.S. states in lead exposure. Additionally, several municipalities in Pennsylvania, including the City of Pittsburgh, show elevated lead in domestic drinking water during EPA-mandated periodic testing, above the EPA action limit of 15 parts per billion (ppb) by weight for 10% or more of the homes tested."

    "text": "Lead is here\nPennsylvania, and Pittsburgh in particular, are at risk for home lead exposure because of the age of the houses. This is demonstrated nicely in the figure below.\n\n\n\nPercentage of homes built before 1950, when lead pipes were banned, by 2010 U.S. Census tract. Source: PA Dept. of Health, 2014.8\n\n\nMost recently, elevated levels of lead in drinking water were found at home testing sites in Pittsburgh in June 2016 (90th percentile reading of 22 ppb)9 and December 2016 (90th percentile reading of 18 ppb)10. Water leaving treatment facilities shows no detectable level of lead. The major source of lead in drinking water is from downstream plumbing, such as lead service lines and lead solder and fixtures inside homes. An internal audit by the city showed that no record exists of where city-owned lead service lines are located, although preliminary efforts to survey the city for lead services lines have begun11. The leaching of lead into the water supply can be moderated by proper chemical buffering of the water at the treatment plant, but the optimal buffer chemistry has not yet been determined. A voluntary screening program by the city, which gives residents the opportunity to submit their own water samples for testing, showed 12% of the volunteer samples to be above the 15 ppb EPA limit as of February 2017, with the volunteer samples coming disproportionately from higher-income neighborhoods – these results likely underestimate the city-wide average. However, the city has not been able to keep up with the demand to test water samples: only 396 of the 1,076 samples have been analyzed as of February 2017. Of note, the volunteer testing showed no geographic correlation of the measured lead level: houses in the same neighborhood, or even on the same block, showed widely varying lead levels. Therefore, each and every home must be tested individually. This emphasizes the need for low-cost and rapid screening methods and tools, with sufficient reliability and limits of detection. Currently, there is no method that will allow rapid measurements, on site, specific to lead and sensitive down to the EPA mandated action level of 15 ppm. Our work fulfills this need."

I mean I really like coffee, enough that “coffee” appears at least three times in my Ph.D. thesis that has nothing whatsoever to do with coffee. But I’ve never had the patience or inclination to obsess over every step of the brewing process. I have at least half a dozen coffee-making apparatus that I pick from according to my mood, but the ol’ Mr. Coffee drip machine gets the most action. I use whole beans from a bag purchased from the grocery store that I measure with a spoon and grind with an economy conical-burr grinder. My water is always 100C or a few seconds post-boil. I time using the clock in my head. I don’t spend a ton of money on fancy gadgets, roast my own beans, measure by weight, or precisely control the temperature and extraction period. So, I’m only halfway committed to coffee nirvana, but I just don’t have time for more. On the occasion that I want a fancy cup, I trust a professional and go to one of our many fine coffee joints here in Pittsburgh.\nBut I do like to play and experiment in the kitchen. Here’s one of my recent adventures."

    "text": "The French Press\nMost people are probably familiar with the french press. It’s a cylindrical pitcher with a mesh plunger that is likely a distant cousin of the Stirling engine. The mode of operation is simple enough:\n\nAdd coffee, coarsely ground\nAdd water and stir\nPlace plunger at the top the pitcher\nWait\nPush down the plunger to shove the grounds to the bottom\nPour and drink\n\nSome nice things about french presses is that they often make 1 L or so of coffee and require no power other than a source of hot water. There are no disposable filters to deal with. I won’t weigh in on the pros and cons of coffee made this way, other than the fact that the grounds are never really removed from the coffee. So, some usually gets left in the joe itself, and cleanup can be a pain, especially if the grounds have sat in the bottom of the pitcher for a long time…\nSo, I started doing something a little different. The original motivation was to find an easy way to remove the grounds as soon as the brewing is finished. In principle, the plunger should push the grounds out of the way and prevent further extraction, but in practice, unless you pour all the coffee immediately, it doesn’t quite work because the plunger isn’t long enough to reach the bottom and really squeeze the grounds. I’ll typically make a full liter and nurse it over a couple of hours, so that last cup can look and taste like used motor oil (or at least bad turkish coffee, and by bad, I mean how it turns out when I try to make it). I know, I know, letting the coffee sit in the pitcher for a long time is uncouth, but I don’t have time to brew each cup separately. (Side note: they should make tea cozies for french presses to keep the coffee warm, but I did finally find a cheap french press with a double-walled insulated pitcher, from IKEA of all places…)\n\nInverting the press\nAnyway, here is my solution: put the grounds on top of the plunger. It goes like this\n\nPlace plunger about halfway down the pitcher\nAdd coffee, coarsely ground\nAdd water and stir\nPush the plunger to the bottom\nWait\nPull out the plunger, slowly, with the grounds, and then discard the grounds\nPour and drink\n\nPulling out the plunger can be messy, so do it over a sink or trash can, but otherwise, I like this for giving me a pitcher of joe that will last a while without becoming bitter. There’s an interesting sucking action that happens as you pull out the plunger, reminding me of the fancy Clover machines you see in some Starbucks, but without the $10k price tag. The resulting coffee seems to be milder in my opinion than conventionally brewed french press coffee, but I haven’t done a scientific study.\nGive it a try, and tell me what you think! If nothing else, its an interesting novelty, and may even work its way into your coffee repetoire."

Under U.S. law, all research done on human subjects must be reviewed by an internal committee at the institution conducting the research to ensure that no harm or potential harm is done to subjects of the research. The IRB also reviews research on animal subjects to make sure the work is humane. Today it seems obvious that research should not needlessly endanger the subjects, but in the not-so-distant past an “ends justifies the means” attitude was taken by some scientists, particularly if the subjects were perceived as having less value than the average citizen. Racial and ethic minorities, prisoners, and the mentally impaired were all considered little better than animals by various researchers. And while it is easy to condemn the horrific work of Nazi scientists on Jews and other minorites during World War II, the United States has its own history of malicious research. A particularly vile example is the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis experiments in which unsuspecting African-American patients were deliberately infected with syphilis and intentionally denied treatment so that the scientists could study the progression of the disease. This lasted from the 1930s until it was shutdown by the government in 1972 thanks to a whistleblower leaking to the press and the subsequent public outrage.\nAlthough IRBs were initially tasked with overseeing human research, they have expanded to cover animal subjects, and sometimes non-medical research on humans (e.g.~sociological surveys). The purpose of the latter type of review is not so much to prevent physical harm to subjects, but to prevent their information from being used against them. Typically, we require procedures to protect the identities of the subjects, for example."

The resident is concerned but doesn’t have the resources to fix the plumbing or install filters. Although we’re trying to help them stay safe, we’ve now caused financial and emotional stress.\n\n\nCase 2\nSimilar to the last case, but the resident is renting. Under law, the landlord has an obligation to fix the pipes or they can no longer rent out the home. The landlord could use this as an excuse to evict the resident rather than pay repair costs.\n\n\nCase 3\nWe collect data on many homes in a neighborhood, and somehow our data get stolen. A malicious developer uses our data to get properties condemned and then purchases them to build a new apartment complex. The original residents are forced out and can not afford to live in the new housing.\nThese may be extreme examples, but our main point is that we don’t want anyone to be harmed by participating in our study."

So, in the literature that we distribute to potential subjects, we have lots of weasel-words. Our results are only “suggestive” of the presence of lead, for example. If we get a positive result, we encourage people to follow up with an EPA-certified test. (Fortunately, the City of Pittsburgh will pay for testing, but the wait is long.)\nWe also have to protect our data in the case of potential lawsuits.

    "text": "What’s a qubit?\nQuantum computers typically store data in what are called “quantum bits” or “qubits.” A classical bit is a piece of information that can have two possible values, traditionally called 0 and 1. Qubits can similarly be either 0 or 1, but can also be superpositions of these two states. For example, the state could be half 0 and half 1, or one quarter 0 and three-quarters 1. (For experts, I’m ignoring normalization here for the sake of simplicity.) Or the proportions can even take values that are complex numbers, half 0 and √-1 halves of 1.\nAt the end of every quantum computing algorithm, we need to read out the qubits as classical information: back to plain 0’s and 1’s. Depending on the proportions of 0 and 1 in the quantum state, we get a random chance of reading 0 or 1 when we do this conversion. Naturally, this final readout step loses information. We can recapture the information by repeating the calculation many times and building up statistics of the classical 0’s and 1’s from the readout step. To complicate matters more, there are an infinite number of ways to readout the state, and they give different, but related, results. With enough data of enough types of readings, we can say what the actual quantum state was at the end of the calculation, to within some statistical uncertainty.\nOur game simulates this readout process. The players must use the data they collect to determine the actual state of the qubit. I won’t go into the theory here, but it’s laid out in full in the paper. Here I’ll describe how to play the game."

If the value of the die falls within the range shown on the table entry, then the Experiment reports a result of “one.” Otherwise, the Experiment reports a result of “zero.”\nNow the Scientist has two choices:\n\nGuess the state based on the data collected. A correct guess ends the round but an incorrect guess results in a penalty.\nCollect more data by going back to Step 2 and asking for another measurement (may be the same as before or different).\n\n\nOnce the Scientist guesses the secret state correctly, the round ends. The Scientist’s score for this round is the number of measurements performed plus a 5 point penalty for each incorrect guess. Like golf, a lower score is better.\nNow the players swap roles and begin a new round. After a predetermined number of rounds (3 rounds in each role is a good number), the player with the lowest total score wins!"

    "text": "What does it all mean?\nThe game demonstrates a few important properties of quantum measurements. First, the measurement process is inherently random. This is not a defect of the measurement, but a fundamental property of quantum mechanics. Second, although the measurement is random, there are some combinations of measurements and states that give the same result every time. When this happens, we say the state is an “eigenstate” of the measurement with an “eigenvalue” equal to the measurement result. For example, in the Game Table above state A is an eigenstate of measurement X with corresponding eigenvalue 1, and state B is also an eigenstate of measurement X, but with eigenvalue 0. Eigenstates are special indeed: knowing the eigenstates and eigenvalues of a measurement lets us calculate the measurement probabilities of every other state. Third, with the exception of eigenstates, we can never be 100% sure of what the secret state is. The best we can do is take a lot of data and reduce our uncertainty. This means that there is always a gamble associated with guessing the state (again, except for eigenstates).\nOne of the difficulties is interpreting the data in a quantitative way. Guessing the state based on “intuition” is good enough for human players, but for a computer to play the Scientist role it must be able to turn hunches into numbers and evaluate them. This is pretty straightforward using tools of statistical estimation, but there are a couple of twists. On the other hand, a suprisingly hard task for the computer is knowing which measurements maximize the amount of new information gained. I’ll discuss these ideas in a later post and perhaps a paper.\nThere are a lot of other goodies about quantum mechanics hidden in the game, but these are the key points to get you started. Try it out, and then take a look at the paper for some other Game Tables (without eigenstates!) and the theory behind it all.\nEnjoy, and happy state hunting!"

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\n\nTime dilation\nTime dilation can be stated simply as “moving clocks are slower than stationary clocks.” In Einstein’s first paper on Special Relativity2, he gives a nice derivation of this using a thought experiment with a moving train. If I call the time measured on the stationary clock as t and the moving clock as t’, the two values are related by\n\\[  t = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}\\,t' \\]\nwhere v is the speed of the moving clock, as measured by the stationary clock, and c is the speed of light. The factor out in front of t’ appears often enough that we’ll give it a new name, γ. One important prediction of relativity is that no massive object can move faster than light, so v &lt; c, making γ &gt; 1 and, therefore, t &gt; t’. So, the stationary clock records a longer time interval than the moving clock. Or, as we said before “moving clocks are slower.”\n\n\nGravitational redshift\nThis one is a bit tricker and not really discussed in undergraduate courses. To really get to the meat of General Relativity we have to talk about geometry and curved spacetime. That’s deeper that I want to go in this post, but a good way to think about this is that, to a first approximation, a clock in a gravitational field will slow down proportional to its change in potential energy.\nFor example, a clock with mass m at rest in empty space has an energy of E = mc2. (You already knew that, right?) If we put this clock near a massive object (like the Earth) with mass M, we add the potential energy of gravity to the energy. For things less massive than black holes, we can just use the Newtonian gravitational energy, so the total energy of a clock at rest near Earth is\n\\[ E' = mc^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} \\]\nwhere G is Newton’s gravity constant and r is the distance from the center of the Earth to our clock.\nThe gravitational redshift says that our clock’s time measurement will be proportional to its change in energy, so\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nt'/t &= E'/E \\\\\nt' &= t \\frac{E'}{E} = t \\left( 1 - \\frac{GM}{c^2r}\\right).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBecause t’ &gt; t, our clock runs slower near Earth than in deep space. We could have included kinetic energy into E’ also, adding time dilation to our equation. Then the combined clock shift is\n\\[ t = t' \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}\\right)/\\left(1 - \\frac{GM}{c^2r}\\right). \\tag{1} \\]"

    "section": "The experiment",
    "text": "The experiment\nThe original experiment by Hafele and Keating was simple enough: put atomic clocks on airplanes and fly them around the world, and then compare their times with a stationary clock on the ground. A typical commerical airplane at the time was the Boeing 707, which had a cruising airspeed of v = 977 km/hr = 271 m/s. A typical altitude for a transcontinental flight might be something like h = 12,000 m above sea level.\nFor the actual experiment Hafele and Keating got the flight logs from the flights and used these to estimate the velocity and height of the airplanes along their entire trajectory. Let’s simplify things a bit so that we can do a quicker calculation. Our airplanes will depart from Mariscal Sucre International Airport (UIO), which is outside of Quito, Ecuador, just south of the Equator. We’ll place one clock there, which we’ll call “L” for “Land clock.” At midnight, two airplanes will take off, one flying due East with a groundspeed of 270 m/s (as measured by a land-based observer) and the other flying due West with a groundspeed of 270 m/s. Let’s name the clock aboard these planes “E” and “W.” We’ll assume the planes never need to stop for fuel (mid-air refueling?) until they go completely around the globe and return to Quito.\nThe Earth’s circumference is almost exactly 40,000 km (Thanks, Napoleon!), so clock L will record a time for the flights of\n\\[\nt_L = \\frac{4\\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{m}}{271\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} = 147601.47601476\\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 41\\,\\textrm{hours}.\n\\]\nNothing interesting there. However, to calculate the time recorded by the airplane clocks, we have to use Eq. (1) above. But, not so fast!, the time t in the equation is for a clock that is not moving and not affected by gravity. Our land clock L does experience gravity, and it is also moving as the Earth rotates, so t ≠ tL. To do the calculation, we need to imagine another clock, that I’ll call “S” for “Space clock” that is stationary and far away from gravity, say half way between the sun and Alpha Centauri.\nTo use Eq. (1), we identify t = tS and t’ = tL. So, our imaginary astronaut reading clock S will say that the airplane flights took a time of\n\\[\nt_S = t_L \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}\\right)/\\left(1 - \\frac{GM}{c^2r}\\right).\n\\]\nWe need to put in the values of the variables. Here’s a quick summary, plus a few values we’ll need later for the airplanes:\n\n\n\nSymbol\nDefinition\nValue\n\n\n\n\nr\nradius of Earth\n40,000 km / 2π\n\n\nGM\nNewton’s constant times mass of Earth3\n3.986 × 1014 m3/s2\n\n\nc\nspeed of light\n2.99792458 × 108 m/s\n\n\nvL\nspeed of Land clock\n\\[\\frac{40,000\\,\\mathrm{km}}{1\\,\\textrm{day}} = 463 \\mathrm{m/s} \\]\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\nh\naltitude of airplanes\n12,000 m\n\n\nvE\nspeed of East-bound airplane\nvL + 271 m/s = 734 m/s\n\n\nvW\nspeed of West-bound airplane\nvL - 271 m/s = 192 m/s\n\n\n\nOk, so now we can get a number for the time of the flight measured by the Space clock. Substituting above, we get tS = 147601.476117763. So, the time difference between clock S and clock L is tS-tL = 0.000103003 s = 103.003 μs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s a lot of digits in the clock times. We need them because we need to subtract two large numbers that are almost the same. A cleaner approach is to use Taylor series approximations of the equations using the facts that |v| &lt;&lt; c and h &lt;&lt; r. Then the subtraction mostly cancels algebraically, leaving only the interesting parts.\n\n\n\nNow, we use the same formula to calculate the airplane clock times, replacing the “L” variables with the “E” or “W” variables. The E and W clocks read\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nt_E &= 147601.476014494\\,\\mathrm{s}; \\\\\nt_W &= 147601.476014906\\,\\mathrm{s}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSo, finally, the differences between the Land clock and the airplanes clocks are\ntL - tE = 0.000000266 s = 266 ns and tL - tW = -0.000000146 s = -146 ns.\nThis is a tiny amount! After a voyage of 40 hours, the clocks shift by billionths of a second. That works out to less than a part in 1012 error per second in the clocks. Luckily, portable atomic clocks at the time had a stability of about a part in 1014, so the experiment was just within the capabilities of the technology. (The uncertainty in the planes’ trajectories was a larger source of error.) The actual numbers for the experiment4 and their uncertainties are\n\n\n\nPlane\nPredicted shift (ns)\nMeasured shift (ns)\n\n\n\n\nEast\n+40 ± 23\n+59 ± 10\n\n\nWest\n-275 ± 21\n-273 ± 7\n\n\n\nThe numbers are off compared to our simplified prediction above, but the order of magnitude is correct and the general trend is correct. Not too bad considering we don’t have the original flight data!"

    "text": "Conclusion\nI’m still amazed that we can measure relativity in such a simple way as putting clocks on airplanes. Of course going faster and flying higher will give larger clock shifts relative to a land-based clock. The GPS satellites have been serving this function continuously since they first came on line. Essentially the satellites are just atomic clocks that broadcast their time and position. The GPS receiver calculates the relative delay of the signal from multiple satellites to solve for its position and time.\nOne of my favorite GPS stories goes back to the original testing of that system5. The Air Force generals in charge of the program didn’t believe the scientists’ “voodoo talk” about this relativity stuff, so the original code for the GPS receivers did not include any relativistic corrections. During the first test, the position numbers started slowly but surely drifting away and the test was considered a failure. Then one of the engineers dramatically walked over and flipped a switch on the back of the receiver box. Magically everything started working. He had secretly added the relativity code against orders and rigged up the switch to turn it on, thereby saving the day. Once again the moral of the story is “don’t bet against Einstein.”"

In this case, the DAMOP conference consists of academic faculty, students, and researchers in atomic physics and related areas. Most of the ~1000 attendees are graduate students. The main purposes of attending a conference are\n\nTo share the work you’ve done and get feedback from your peers,\nTo see what others are working on and learn the latest advances, and\nTo meet people and make connections for future work, future employment, or simply to make friends with the same interests as you."

    "section": "What happens at a conference",
    "text": "What happens at a conference\nThe main order of business is the presentation of talks and posters. Each conference does this in a slightly different way, but a typical day at DAMOP consists of oral sessions, snack breaks, and the poster session.\nThe oral sessions happen in the morning (starting at 8 a.m.) and first part of the afternoon. At any instant there are 8 rooms were talks are happening, grouped by subject matter. DAMOP is broad enough that usually most of the 8 sessions don’t have much topical overlap, so you can pick a room and stay there for the ~2 hours until the break. However, sometimes you have to switch rooms to see all of the talks that are interesting to you.\n\nDeciding what talks to see\nA good conference goer will pore over the program ahead of time and plan their schedule for the day. (Unfortunately, that’s not me.) Talks at DAMOP come in two flavors.\nInvited talks are, as the name suggests, given by people nominated by the organizing committee of the conference. These are longer talks (30 minutes) that can give good background information on a field as well as, often, the most interesting new results. The presenters are usually professors or senior researchers, but sometimes advanced graduate students or post-docs will be invited to give talks.\nContributed talks are volunteer talks, if you will. Researchers submit abstracts a few months before the conference on work they would like to present. The organizing committee reads through these, approves them, and sorts them into categories. These are short talks (12 minutes), typically given by students and post-docs. (I’ll talk about preparing for the conference in a later post.)\nMy personal priorities for choosing talks are these:\n\n1. Work similar to my own (obviously, this means my own students get top billing!)\nThis is the main reason to be at the conference. By seeing work similar to my own, I learn about things I should be doing (new experimental techniques, new analysis methods, theory predictions of interesting things I can measure), things I shouldn’t be doing (techniques that don’t work or are too difficult for me, dead ends unveiled by the theorists that may not be otherwise obvious), and things I may want to do in the future. In science, it is fair game to copy what other people are doing, so long as you give them credit. A conference is a great place to absorb a lot of these ideas in a short amount of time. I’ll say a little about how I listen to individual talks below.\n\n\n2. Presentations by leaders in the field\nAfter you’ve done work in a field long enough, you learn the BIG NAMES. At the conference, these are usually invited talks, so they are easy to identify in the program even if you’re not yet familiar with the people in your research field. Going to these talks gives me a good idea of the future of the field, and often contain the “oh, wow” moments of the conference. In short, this is where I go for inspiration.\n\n\n3. Presentations by friends and co-workers\nI also use conferences to get updates on what my old friends are doing professionally. Along the way I’ve met a lot of people that I consider friends, but don’t get to see them regularly. Former classmates, labmates, bosses, students, drinking buddies, etc. fall into this category. I try to go to their talks even if they’re totally unrelated to the work I’m going.\nIt’s also just a nice thing to do. Giving talks is intimidating, even if you’ve done it a million times, so seeing a few friendly faces in the crowd is encouraging. And it gives me an easy topic of conversation if I’ve been out-of-touch for a while.\n\n\n4. Random talks\nSo this one is a little peculiar to myself, but if I have a gap in my schedule I like to drop into some random room (especially if there are a lot of people watching) to see what’s going on, even if it’s way out of my realm. Yesterday, for example, I sat through a couple of talks about using cold atoms to search for dark matter and other astro-physicky things. A lot of it was over my head, but it’s stimulating to think of all the possible things that one can do.\n\n\n\nHow to watch talks\nThere’s an art to watching conference talks. There is way too much information to absorb at once, and if you try your brain will turn into mush by the end of the first day. I mostly write down things I want to look up later. I think of talks as a way to see the broad outlines and get references to follow up on later. Most presenters will put bibliographic references in their talks. I write these down to look up later. Or, in the very least, I’ll write down the presenter’s name (or advisor’s name) and look them up on the internet later. I notably don’t try to transcribe the entire talk, or even do detailed notes unless it is something I really, really need to get now.\nOne recent trend that personally annoys me are folks in the audience who photograph every slide of every talk. This is distracting to me, and I think it is also a bit sketchy in terms of intellectual property. Most presenters will gladly send you a copy of their powerpoint slides if you ask, or at least they can give you copies of relevant papers. Taking photographs also means you’re paying more attention to your phone than you are the talk itself, and its unlikely that staring at blurry pictures of graphs and equations will teach you anything later.\nUnless the presenter has gone over the time limit, there is an opportunity for the audience to ask questions at the end of the talk. Questions should be specific and relevant so as to not waste time. More detailed inquiries or discussion should happen outside of the session. Don’t be afraid to approach someone with questions! If there’s something you don’t understand, most presenters are happy to discuss their work later during the breaks, especially if the questioner is a student.\n\n\nHow to navigate the poster sessions\nTypically the poster sessions are held in large exhibit halls or ballrooms. At DAMOP there are about 150 posters in each session. The main purpose of the poster sessions is to stimulate discussion. I like to wind my way through the hall and at least lay eyes on every poster. I rarely read an entire poster. Instead, if I see something interesting, I’ll ask the poster’s author to tell me about their work. That way I can get a condensed version and respond with questions if there are things I don’t understand. I can also ask for more detail than the poster itself contains.\nI also tend to put on my professor hat when looking at posters. If I see a student standing by a poster looking nervous and lonely, I’ll stop and talk to them. Getting that little bit of attention from a stranger can be a big boost in confidence. I know from my own experience how bad it feels to stand in front of your poster for a couple of hours waiting for someone to come by. So, I try to throw some encouragement when I can.\nThe other function of the poster session is social. This is a time to meet up with friends and colleagues and talk about science or just decompress after a long day of brainwork. It’s also a good time to track down presenters you saw earlier in the day and ask more detailed questions about their talks. A lot of research collaborations happen from their spontaneous discussions in the isles of the poster hall.\n\n\nConclusion\nThat’s all I’ll say for now. I think the next post will discuss the session I attended yesterday on the graduate school admissions process. And then I’ll conclude (out of sequence, I know), with a post about how to prepare for conference."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last week I sat down with a colleague from the math department who had the thankless task of evaluating my teaching. First, a little background. Most evaluations at our university are done by tenured faculty within the same department, but because our department is small, my reviews usually come from folks in the other science departments. This time around, the usual chemistry and biology people were too busy, so I ventured out to the math department to ask for a review. It turned out that this was a great idea.\nAnyone in physics knows how much math we use. In fact, we probably take it for granted. Just as an example, at our university the physics B.S. degree already contains enough classes for a math minor, and is only about three courses short of a full second degree in math. And anyone who teaches physics or takes a physics class knows that we spend a lot of time teaching math: vectors, calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, the list goes on….\nSo, with that as context, my math colleague sat in on two of my quantum mechanics lectures and saw first hand how we use math in physics and how integral it is to what we do. Reading between the lines of our later discussion, I think she had two reactions. First, she was grateful that her former students were actually using the things that she taught them, instead of that knowledge sinking into the void. And second, she saw how we emphasize slightly different things when we use math in physics than what she does as a mathematician. This led to a long talk between us about what math we need in physics and how we use it, and hopefully a continuing dialog between our departments.\nIn the end, this one simple interaction could make a big future difference to our students by increasing the synergy of their coursework. In academia we, particularly administrators, talk a lot about interdisciplinary collaboration, but it is difficult in practice to make it go. The great obvious-but-ignored commonality between departments is teaching and the students themselves. My epiphany of the week is that we can, and we should, use that link to form bonds between departments.\nSo, to my physics colleagues at other universities, I say go find a math professor and give them a hug, or at least take them out for a cup of coffee."

    "section": "What’s a free electron laser?",
    "text": "What’s a free electron laser?\nA free electron laser (FEL) generates light by wiggling electrons.\nFirst the electrons are accelerated close to the speed of light, then they pass through a bank of alternating magnets (the “undulator”). The magnets bend the trajectory of the electrons into a wiggle shape. Because the electrons are changing direction, they are induced to emit light. The frequency of the light is determined by the initial speed of the electrons and the strength of the magnets. (Classical electrodynamics plus special relativity are sufficient to describe the effect; quantum effects only show up at low flux or extremely high frequencies.)\nInitially, the light is not laser light, but monochromatic incoherent light like from an LED (specifically incoherent synchrotron radiation). However, once the light is bright enough, it starts pushing around the electrons themselves. The electrons are attracted to the nodes of the light waves through the ponderomotive effect. Once the electrons bunch up like this, they are synchronized with each other and emit light as a team, rather than individually. This collective behavior of the electrons causes the light to become coherent – all of the photons are in phase and at the same frequency – and we have laser light.\nIf the undulator is long enough, you don’t even need mirrors to enhance the light field (superradiance effect), but most FELs do have a traditional laser cavity to build up optical power.\nThe key advantages that FELs have over other lasers are\n\nTunability - in principle, you can make any wavelength of electromagnetic radiation with an FEL. FELs exist to make anything from THz radiation to x-rays. Of course a single instrument can only cover a small part of this range, but a decade or more of tunability is common.\nPower - the pulse power goes like the electron beam current squared, so you can get very intense light. Unlike other lasers, there are no thermal lensing effects or degradation of the gain medium at high powers. The limit is basically from the electron accelerator.\n\nThe major disadvantage is complexity and cost. For our particular experiments (mid-infrared spectroscopy), only a handful of FELs exist."

    "text": "How about FELIX?\nThe FELIX laboratory contains three separate FELs: FELIX, FELICE, and FLARE. FELIX proper is the FEL that we use. It has two configurations depending on the desired wavelength range. The output wavelength is tuneable from 3 µm to 45 µm (the range we use) or from 30 µm to 150 µm. Each macro-pulse has an energy of up to 100 mJ at a 1 GHz repetition rate.\nThe FELICE laser is an FEL with experimental space inside a secondary laser cavity for increased power, and FLARE is a longer-wavelength system (THz radiation).\nThere are about fourteen experimental stations holding various experiments using the lasers. Only one experiment can be done at a time on each laser. The experiments we do use two mass-spectrometer systems: a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer and a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer."

    "text": "What is IRMPD?\nWe use FELIX to break molecular ions. If the laser photon energy matches one of the vibrational excitation energies of the molecule, the vibrational mode will be excited. Because there are so many photons, the ions experience many serial excitations until they fall apart. This processes is called InfraRed Multi-Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). IRMPD is a little counterintuitive. A single mid-IR photon doesn’t have enough energy to break apart the ion, but if you add up enough of them, you can. One subtlety is that higher excitations have a lower energy than the ground state excitation because of anharmonic effects, but this dispersion is small compared to the bandwidth of the pulse, so the ions can indeed absorb multiple photons.\nBy scanning the laser wavelength and recording the fraction of ions that are dissociated, we get the excitation spectrum. We compare this data with predicted spectra from quantum chemistry calculations (along with the mass spectra of the ions) to determine the structure of the ions."

    "section": "Geometric Algebra",
    "text": "Geometric Algebra\nThe math we learned as undergraduates to describe the physical world is broken. Since Gibbs introduced vectors in the late 19th century and silenced Hamilton’s quaternions, justly or unjustly, we’ve made them a cornerstone of physics, but they become awkward when we start to talk about rotations or magnetic fields, for example, because we begin trying to paste vectors onto objects that aren’t just “a magnitude plus a direction.” For example, where the heck does the right-hand rule for cross products come from? It’s so bizarre and artificial when you think about it. In the end it traces back to us deciding that x, y, and z should be related to each other in some particular way and we need everything else we do to be consistent with that.\nI first saw this a few years ago when my colleague Michael Huster lent me his copy of Alan Macdonald’s Linear and Geometric Algebra1 which gives an introduction to the topic from a math point of view. I admit that my initial take was that geometric algebra was just some book-keeping trick and not really that useful. In my defense, a lot of the research papers on the topic use GA in just that way, as a superficial compactification of notation.\nI stumbled back onto the topic during my prep for teaching Electrodynamics last year, and started reading through some of David Hestenes’ papers. I guess what hooked me back in was this nagging feeling that the math we use, particularly vector calculus, is an impediment to understanding the physics that it describes. My students always struggle to apply Maxwell’s Equations to problems and I sympathize with them. I realize that the only reason I can navigate the topic is that I’ve memorized a bunch of tricks and informal rules but that I don’t have truly deep intuition beyond what experience tells me is the right way to solve problems. I think that by better understanding the structure of geometry (whether or not geometric algebra is the right tool for that), I might gain some insight into how the universe is constructed.\nThe book Geometric Algebra for Physicists by Chris Doran and Anthony Lasenby 2 is a good overview written from a physics perspective. It seems like Electrodynamics is one of the topics where this has the biggest impact. For example, all of Maxwell’s Equations can be reduced to a single equation in this system. Special relativity and rigid body dynamics are also especially nice. They even spend time discussing quantum mechanics in this context, although I’m more skeptical of that one."

    "text": "What’s the basic idea?\nGeometric Algebra comes from W. K. Clifford’s work in the late 1890’s to build up higher dimensional objects from products of vectors without throwing away information. What I mean by this is that the two vector products that we learn, the dot product and the cross product, both throw something away – in some ways they complement each other. Clifford combined the two into a “geometric product” to build areas and volumes out of vectors in a seemless way. The underlying philosophy of Geometric Algebra is right there in the name: geometry and algebra should be intimately related. Hestenes has done a ton of advocacy for this idea, particularly for physics. Another key constituency are computer scientists who have embraced GA as the way to put geometry into code.\nThe key ingredient is the “geometric product” of two vectors. It is defined (using notation familiar to physics students) as:\n\\[ = + i , \\]\nwhere the dot is the usual vector dot product, \\( \\) is the vector cross product, and i behaves like imaginary i in that \\( i^2 = -1 \\), but is really a geometric object called the “unit pseudoscalar” related to the 3d volume element. (I’m nerfing things a bit. The better definition has as the last term \\( \\), but most students haven’t seen the wedge product \\( \\) before.) Note that the resulting object breaks an old rule that’s drilled into us from traditional vector algebra: it’s a scalar plus a vector. In our old way of thinking you can’t do that – add scalars to vectors – but doing away with that rule has a lot of implications. With these new rules GA ends up subsuming a lot of higher math beyond vectors: quaternions, differential forms, matrices, etc. I won’t say more here, but if you’re interested check it out yourself!"

These books are a small crack in the wall to help me think about these things.\nOh, and I now think conformal geometry is cool and can probably solve some nagging questions that have been in my head for a while about the shape of gaussian laser beams.

But those physics courses were all classes that we understood, because all of the faculty took classes like that in our Ph.D. work. What to replace those with was not so obvious. We did, however, have a clear goal for our students: to get them jobs.\nSo, we went out and started talking to people who had jobs.\nBy that, I mean that we started talking to recent alumni who were working in industry, either immediately after graduating with a bachelor’s degree or who had gone on to a graduate degree before entering the non-academic workforce. Our department chair contacted a couple of former students that she had kept in touch with, and we arranged to visit them. I also reached out to my former students who were just starting in their jobs.\nWe asked a set of simple questions: * What do you do? * What did you learn as an undergraduate that prepared you for your job? * What skills did you have to learn after you started your job? * How does your education as a physicist distinguish you from coworkers?\nThe answers we got were perhaps not surprising, but they showed us our blind spots coming from the academic world. Some of the key items were * Hands-on experience with specific equipment and software. (Shout out to Sean Krupa for providing a detailed list.) * Knowledge of how industrial R&D works. From mundane things like terminology (e.g. I had no idea what Tech Readiness Levels were) to broader concepts like stakeholder interest, care and feeding of intellectual property, project life-cycles, allocation of effort, and organizational patterns. * Communication, communication, communication. Everything from how to present at weekly meetings, proper business email etiquette, writing formal progress reports, to requesting funds from higher-ups or investors. One general theme was presenting technical information to non-technical audiences.\nWe also talked with the co-workers and bosses of some of our alumni. It was also encouraging to hear how useful a physics education is in the workplace beyond the obvious things. Some highlights: * Resilience - physicists are tenacious problem solvers who don’t give up easily when solutions are not apparent or require many steps, and they are not discouraged by failure. * Flexibility - physicists are great at working outside their comfort zone and learning new things when needed.\nWith notes in hand, we set out to combine those best attributes of a traditional academic physics education with the skills we saw used in real jobs. This lead to four program learning objectives. Upon completion of the program, our students will 1. Demonstrate content knowledge relevant to current science and technology enterprises, 2. Demonstrate knowledge and skills for measurement and control of physical variables, 3. Develop and use computational models and simulations of physical phenomena and processes, and acquire, process, and analyze data from experiments, and 4. Communicate scientific, technical, and professional information in variety of formats used in industrial/business settings: written and oral, formal and informal."

To make this program fly we had to lean into our strengths, so we created courses that match the expertise already in place.\n\nTechnical Core\nRather than more traditional physics course offerings, we selected specific skills that our faculty have that translate to a commercial or government R&D environment. The courses are lecture-lab hybrids, to give our students hands-on experience with equipment and techniques.\nFor my part, I’ll be teaching “Advanced Optical Theory and Devices.” I took Sean’s notes and identified a handful of projects that tie together concepts and techniques used in optical systems. Tentatively, the main themes are imaging, interferometry, and optical sensing. Students will design and build full optical systems using industrial software and tools.\nLet me briefly highlight a few other courses. * Fatiha Benmokhtar will teach “Data Acquisition and Control” using her experience with high speed electronics from working on particle accelerator experiments. * Monica Sorescu will teach “Materials Science”, showcasing her expertise in the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials. * We are very fortunate to be joined by Yang Wang, Senior Computational Scientist at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. He will bring his skills in high performance computing for the modeling of quantum materials to our “Computational Physics” course.\n\n\nBusiness Core\nThe other key element of our program is a set of foundational business courses to prepare our students for the corporate world as either potential managers or entrepreneurs. Our colleagues at the Palumbo-Donahue School of Business worked with us to find a set of courses that wil give our graduates a head start. We also are aiming for maximum flexibility, so we picked classes that are available as either traditional or on-line courses.\nWhile this topic is out of my wheelhouse, I think our students will be well-prepared to think about product life-cycles and business development from root to stem. ### Real-world experience Lastly, our program includes an industrial internship and capstone project. Developing this has been a fun one for me. I stepped outside my comfort zone to meet with tech industry leaders here in Pittsburgh, seeking partners willing to host students. Pittsburgh is a regional hub for a lot of the big names in data and tech, and robotics has a strong presence locally. I’m not allowed to name-drop yet, but I’ve been talking to companies working on things as varied as self-driving vehicles, materials science, quantum computing, and AI."

Building up the recruiting campaign for this new program has been another novel experience for me. Let’s just say we’re trying it all: web ads, direct email, direct mail, Facebook, Linked-In, job fairs, and probably a half-dozen other avenues. I’ve never been involved with this side of the university before. Our undergraduate admissions is largely automatic from the perspective of the faculty. Graduate recruiting, however, needs a more personal touch. We had to get the message just right to connect with folks that best match our program. We lack the name recognition of larger schools, but I hope our attention to detail and the care that went into building this program comes through to our prospectives. Time will tell, but we’re getting a good response so far."

    "text": "Motivation\n\nCase 1: Imaging problems\nWhen teaching undergraduate optics, I always found the problems containing series of lenses and mirrors tedious. The standard solution is to find the image of an object created by each optical element using Gauss’s Lens equation. This image then becomes the object for the next element. Apply Gauss’s equation again. Rinse and repeat. For one or two lenses this is not too bad, but once you get to something like a microscope (objective, tube lens, and ocular), then it really drags. Worse, if your object moves a little bit you have to start over. And there is also the weird issue of infinitely far objects and images to deal with. It seems a little incomplete. I’m looking for a better, or at least less tedious, method.\nOne solution is that I can take two rays that pass through my object point and find where they intersect on the output side to locate the image, but that’s still a lot of algebra, and I am lazy.\n\n\nCase 2: Ray tracing\nIn my research lab, we mostly deal with lasers, which to a reasonable approximation can be treated as geometric rays (at least as far as alignment is concerned). When sketching out a new optical setup, I’ll often use ray transfer matrices (also called “ABCD” matrices) to set things up. Each ray is represented as a vector containing the ray height and slope. Each optical element corresponds to a matrix. By multiplying these matrices together we can get a representation of the entire optical system. Matrix times input ray equals output ray.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut wait! There’s more!\n\n\n\nThe same ABCD matrix that describes the path of geometric rays through the system also describes the change in size of Gaussian laser beams as they travel through the system. This seems like magic, because there is no apparent relationship between rays and the size of diffracting laser beams. The detailed proof requires digging into the guts of the diffraction integrals2. Surely there is a simpler explanation. (Arnaud has a nice model using complex-valued rays3, which again seems like magic, but at least understandable magic.)\n\n\nThis is great, as far as it goes, but it assumes all of the lenses and mirrors are perfectly aligned and centered. Often that just isn’t the case. For example, a common right-of-passage for students in a laser lab is learning to inject a beam into a fiber. There’s a lot of degrees of freedom that you have to manage to high precision:\n\nx, y, and z position of the focusing lens\ntwo tilt angles of the lens\ntwo tilt angles of the incomming beam\nthe location of the beam’s waist\n\nCan we put together a concise mathematical model of all of these degrees of freedom?\n\n\nThe goal\nWhat I would really like to do is find a solution that lets me model optical elements in any position or orientation and lets me solve imaging problems. And I would like it to be as simple to use as the ABCD matrices. Can I get there starting from the old-fashioned ABCD matrices?\nThe answer is “yes,” but first I need to re-examine what the ABCD matrices are doing to the rays, in a geometric sense. And to do that, I first need to mathematically define rays as oriented lines."

In this example, a and b &gt; 0 and c&lt;0.\n\n\n\nThe equation of a line\nLet’s start with the equation for a line in two-dimensions. If our coordinate axes are (x,y) then any line will have the form \\(ax+by+c=0\\) . Rather than write down the equation for every line, we could just keep track of the coefficients (a,b,c). Also, if we multiply the whole equation (or all of the coefficients) by a non-zero scalar, we get the same line. In other words, the vector (a,b,c) gives us a homogenous representation of the line.\nI think most of us almost habitually use the slope-intersept form of a line: \\(y = mx+h\\) . In our new represenation we rearrange this to \\(mx -y + h = 0\\) and identify the coeffients as (m,-1,h). (Hold on to this – it will be important.)\n\n\nNormalization\nBecause we can multiply the line coefficients by any nonzero scalar, is there any prefered normalization? For most of what we’ll be doing, the normalization won’t matter, but let’s take a quick peek. One convenient choice is to divide the line coefficients by \\(\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\\) . Then the new a and b coefficients become the direction cosines with respect to those axes and the new c value gives the (signed) distance from the origin to the line. With this normalization, the angle θ between two lines can be calculated easily: \\(\\theta=\\arccos(a_1a_2+b_1b_2)\\) (proven by applying some trig identities).\n\n\nOrientation\nBesides normalization, we have one more degree of freedom that we can assign meaning to: the overall sign of the coefficients. We’ll interpret this as orientation or the direction of travel along the line. For b&gt;0 the line goes left-to-right. If b=0, then a&gt;0 indicates downward. Lastly, if a=b=0, then c&gt;0 is the imaginary line infinitely far away encircling the space in a counter-clockwise direction.\nBy keeping track of these signs, we can build an expression for mirrors that also changes the direction of the rays."

In this example, a and b &gt; 0 and c&lt;0.\n\n\nIn the previous post I defined an oriented line by considering the equation of a line in 2D: $ ax+by+c = 0 $, which we can abbreviate as the vector of coefficients \\((c,a,b)\\). In this post, we want to perform some geometric operations on this line. Namely, we want to move (translate) it, rotate it about the coordinate origin, and switch its orientation (from left-to-right to right-to-left). Once we understand how to manipulate the line, we’ll perform these same transformations on our ABCD matrices.\nFor the sake of brevity, I’ll give the results here and put the derivations at the bottom.\nTo translate a ray by a displacement vector (u, v) we multiply the ray vector from the left by the matrix \\[\nT(u,v) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -u & -v \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\] In other words, the new ray r’ = T r.\nSimilarly, rotations of the rays are represented by the matrix \\[R(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\ 0 & \\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta \\end{pmatrix},\\] giving a new ray r’ = R r.\nFor the ray transfer matrices, both the row space and column space of the matrix must be transformed. If we rotate and then translate, the new matrix is \\(M' = TRMR^{-1}T^{-1}\\).\nOne way to understand why we need two copies of the transformation matrices is this – our ABCD matrices for optical elements assume the element is located at the origin. If we want to place that surface anywhere else, we have to move our coordinates such that the desired optical element location is at the origin, install our element, then restore the original coordinates."

We can model beam-steering elements like galvos, motorized mirrors, or acousto-optics. We can do tolerancing of layouts or vibration analysis with simple matrix multiplication. To an experimentalist like myself with only a handful of math tools in my pocket and insufficient patience to code all of this up in Zemax, this is exciting!\nNow, the skeptics will say this is not new physics.

    "text": "Examples\n\nRight-angle mirror pair\n\n\n\nExample of retroreflector made from two perpendicular mirrors.\n\n\nI have several examples in the paper2, but my favorite is a common lab optic: a right-angle retroreflector. The setup is simple: we have two flat mirrors that intersect at right angles. Any incoming ray will be retroreflected opposite its original direction, offset by some distance.\nThe RTM for the upper mirror (\\(M_1\\)) is generated by a \\(45^{\\circ}\\) rotation of a plane mirror situated at the origin:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_1 &= R_{45^{\\circ}}M_\\text{plane mirror}R_{45^{\\circ}}^{-1}, \\\\\n&=\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & -1/\\sqrt{2} & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSimilarly, the second mirror (\\(M_2\\)) has the RTM \\[\nM_2 = R_{-45^{\\circ}}M_\\text{plane mirror}R_{-45^{\\circ}}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.    \n\\] We choose an incoming ray \\({r}_0 = (-h,-m,1)^T\\) with \\(h&gt;0\\) such that it will strike mirror \\(M_1\\) first, yielding the reflected ray \\[\n{r}_1 = M_1 {r}_0 = (h,1,-m)^T.    \n\\]\nThis ray follows the line \\(h +x-my =0\\), propagating from right to left (\\(b &lt; 0\\)). After the second reflection in \\(M_2\\) the final ray is \\[\n{r}_2 = M_2 {r}_1 = (-h,m,-1)^T,    \n\\] which is antiparallel to the incoming ray, as expected, with a \\(y\\) intercept of \\(-h\\) and propagating right to left (\\(b &lt; 0\\)).\nThat’s a piece-wise description, but we can multiply the two mirror matrices to get the system matrix for the retroreflector:\n\\[\nM_\\text{ra} = M_2 M_1 =\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\] Multiplying this matrix by the original ray gives \\(r_2\\) above in one step.\n\n\nRight-angle prism\nWe can also upgrade our retroreflector to a right-angle prism retroreflector by inserting refracting surfaces before and after the mirror pair. We’ll assume the prism is made of glass with an index of refraction of n. In the mirror setup above, the intersection of the mirrors was located at the coordinate origin. We’ll place the hypotenuese of the prism a distance d to the left of the origin.\nThe matrix for the entrance surface is a refracting surface from index of refraction 1 to index of refraction n, translated to the left by d: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_1 &= T(-d,0)\\,M_\\text{ref}(1,n)\\,T(d,0) \\\\\n    &=\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/n & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -d & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\\\\n    &=\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & (d-nd)/n & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/n & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The matrix for the exit surface is constructed similarly: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_2 &= T(-d,0)\\,M_\\text{ref}(n,1)\\,T(d,0) \\\\\n    &=\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & nd-n & 0 \\\\ 0 & n & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Now, we just combine these two surfaces in the correct order with the right-angle mirrors from above to get our prism matrix: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_\\text{prism} &= S_2 M_\\text{ra} S_1 \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2d(n-1)/n & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] What does this matrix tell us? We still get a retroreflector, as expected, but the outgoing ray is slightly displaced relative to the mirror-pair case. For our now canonical incoming ray \\(r = (h,m,-1)^T\\), we get an outgoing ray \\[\nr' = M_\\text{prism} r =\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2d(n-1)/n & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} h \\\\ m \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} -h + \\frac{2md(n-1)}{n} \\\\ m \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix},\n\\] showing a displacement in the height of \\({2md(n-1)}/{n}\\) relative to the mirror pair (i.e., setting \\(n=1\\))."

That means our angles and beam displacements can’t get too large else our errors will accumulate, particularly for refractive elements and spherical surfaces. (Plane mirrors are perfect!) Specifically, our method says nothing about aberrations because those are, by definition, nonlinear in the ray height and slope, and we are using a strictly linear formulation. Can we extend these ideas to low-order aberrations? I’m looking into a few ideas others have published recently3, so stay tuned. Computer tricks like automatic differentiation might yield a simple, compact way to look beyond the paraxial limit without doing full-bore ray tracing.\n\n\nThe Third Dimension\nExtending the ray matrices to three dimensions is fairly straight forward, but a bit cumbersome as we need 6×6 matrices. Lin has one method that keeps things looking similar to the 2-D case4, but I’m looking into the prefered representation of the computer graphics folks: Plücker coordinates, which are a true homogeneous representation of lines in 3D, and thus preserve geometric information in a covariant way.5 This will be important to investigating points and planes (see next post!)."

    "text": "Appendix: Derivations\nHere I walk through how the translation and rotation matrices are constructed. The rotation matrices you may have seen before, although probably not in homogeneous coordinates. The translation matrices are unique to the homogeneous representation. In traditional 2D matrix algebra, translation is not representable by matrix multiplication. Instead, you have to add vectors directly. Being able to put all of the Euclidean transformations into the same form is one of the major benefits of using homogeneous coordinates.\n\nTranslation\nOur first task is to shift our line by a constant vector (u,v). Equivalently, we can move our coordinate axis by the opposite translation. In other words, we can do \\( x \\rightarrow x-u, y \\rightarrow y-v \\). Substituting this change into the line equation, we have \\[ a(x-u) + b(y-v) + c = 0, \\] \\[ ax + by + (-au -bv + c) = 0. \\] The coefficents are transforming line \\( a \\rightarrow a, b \\rightarrow b, c \\rightarrow c-au-bv \\). Working backwards, we can represent this transformation of the coefficients as a matrix equation: \\[ \\begin{pmatrix}c \\\\ a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -u & -v \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}c \\\\ a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}. \\] We identify the matrix here as the translation operator and we’ll give it the name \\[ T(u,v) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -u & -v \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \\] Note that only the c coefficient changes. If our line coefficients happend to be normalized such that \\( a^2 + b^2 = 1 \\), then c is the distance of the line from the origin. What does this mean? Because only c is changing, any translation of a line can be interpreted as motion towards or away from the origin. Any motion perpendicular to that would simply shift the line along itself, resulting in no change to the line.\n\n\nRotation\nNow we’d like to rotate the line. Rotation of the line by an angle θ about the coordinate origin is equivalent to rotating the axes by the opposite angle -θ.

    "text": "I just updated the format of the website. Partly this was to make it easier for me to maintain, and partly it was to (hopefully) encourage me to write more. Please excuse any sloppiness (and the boring default theme) while I get things running again.\nThe old website was built using Jekyll. At the time, this was the easiest platform to host on GitHub Pages. But keeping up with patches in Jekyll was becoming a pain, so I dumped it. (Jekyll is built on Ruby, but I’m not a regular Ruby user.)\n\n\n\nAfter looking around a bit, I switched over to Quarto. Quarto, like Jekyll, uses Markdown as the main file format, but it uses Pandoc in the background to compile the markdown into html or LaTeX (and then onto PDF). I already have some experience with Pandoc (e.g. I’ve been using it for my course syllabi for a while now), so I already understand its limitations and quirks. The activation barrier was low.\nBut on top of Pandoc, Quarto allows you to write generative documents, in the sense that you can embed code (R, python, javascript, etc.) into the document to generate plots, figures, etc. I played around with this feature a little back in the Spring to generate my Acoustics lecture notes, and I liked it. (I also built a couple of “live” documents using Shiny to embed interactive apps into the pages, but the overhead is still a bit high for everyday use.) I think this will let me do a few more interesting things in my blog posts.\nSo, stay tuned!\nOn deck:\n\nPart 3 of my geometric optics paper discussion. The paper was published a few weeks ago, so I need to finish that up by showing you how to use matrices to solve imaging problems directly. Links to Part 1 and Part 2.\nIntro to Markov chain Monte Carlo for fitting data, from a physicist’s point of view. I’m using this technique for analysing my water quality data, and it seems like a useful things to share. The cool thing is that I can build a realistic model of how my experiment works (including details like instrument response, measurements errors, and chemical kinetics), and extract physically important fitting parameters (and their uncertainties) without doing a lot of algebra and calculus contortions."

The usual way that these topics are taught and used is though algebraic methods (e.g. solving Gauss’s imaging equation). By rethinking where these equations come from, we gain insight into the relationships between light rays and images. Mathematical tools like projective geometry (which has mostly been forgotten since the end of the 1800s) and Clifford’s geometric algebra unify these various descriptions of light."

The latest version of the device is sensitive to lead down to about 2 ppb concentrations (by mass), below the EPA action limit of 15 ppb. Another test we are developing is measuring fluoride concentrations and water hardness. Our hope is to make several copies of the device and test homes in the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh near Duquesne and at test sites in South Africa.\nSee my recent blog post for more detail.\nPrevious funding from an InnovationWorks/Department of Defense Technology Transfer Consortia award, and a Duquesne University Charles Henry Leach II grant.\n\n\nLaser-Induced Fluorescence for Quantitation of Cross-Linking in Bio-polymers\nThis work uses fluorescent tags that bind to cross-links in bio-organic polymers.

I also put a bit more time into discussing imaging than most of my colleagues. In the section of the course on wave optics, I put extra emphasis on polarization, using the Jones vector formalism. Although the students are apprehensive of using complex numbers at first, I feel that the practice here is good preparation for discussing spin in quantum mechanics."

The students have already had a multivariable calculus class, math methods in physics class, and the first semester electrostatics, but they still enter this course having only a survival-level understanding of the math. So, we practice a lot. I do a fair bit on the radiation sections of Griffiths, focusing on oscillating fields. Here complex algebra returns. Unfortunately, Griffiths struggles here in my opinion, falling back on hand-waving derivations that aren’t satisfying. However, looking at the analogous sections in Jackson’s tome, it’s clear that the material is beyond the level of the students (polarization potentials, anyone?). Figuring out how to efficiently teach this well is still a work in progress."

I really like this way of thinking about quantum because the students get to learn the axioms of quantum mechanics using linear algebra, which is easier in my opinion than trying to learn quantum mechanics and solving wave equations simultaneously. This way the physics concepts and the math they employ are more easily distinguished. This also appeals to my background in atomic physics, where almost everything can be approximated as a few-level system. Once we do get to wavefunctions, we work primarily with atomic physics examples, doing a detailed deconstruction of the hydrogen atom. I also plug one of my favorite rants in here: the silliness of anthropomorphic units."
